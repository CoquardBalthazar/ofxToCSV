# Description

Python scripts to convert bank export files from the OFX & TSV formats to the CSV format.
In development : Browser window with drop file function

# Original problem

What pushed me to start this project was that the online platform of my banks was no longer offering proper CSV bank export (the option was still there, but the exported file no functional). The other export possibility were either OFX, TSV. However I follow my expenses with an Excel file (thanks to the CSV exports), which led me to create these scripts.

# Next step

I would like to create a browser window with drop file function that would be fully integrated in a website. The idea is based on what we can see with the platform wetransfer.
